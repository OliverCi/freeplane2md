- Introduction {#ID_86446891}
  - 

<p>
      Basically, you just start typing to write text into a node, and end with an
    </p>
    <p>
      ENTER.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      To create a new node press INSERT (on MacOS press TAB) or ENTER.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      To navigate nodes use ARROW-KEYS.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      To fold/unfold press SPACE.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      And to write formatted text you press ALT-ENTER
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      These are the basics and should give you a feeling of what Freeplane is for
    </p>
    <p>
      in its core. Have fun, and ask your questions in the <a href="https://sourceforge.net/p/freeplane/discussion/758437/">freeplane-forum</a>

  - Goal
    - 

<p>
      Freeplane is meant to facilitate thinking, sharing information and getting things done at work, in school and at home. The software supports creating, sharing and using <a href="https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorial_Freeplane#What_is_mind_mapping">mind maps</a>, which are a kind of <a href="http://www.informationtamers.com/WikIT/index.php?title=Information_map_types">information maps</a>. The <a href="https://www.freeplane.org/wiki/index.php/Tutorial_Freeplane">Wiki Tutorial Freeplane</a> contains concrete examples of  <a href="freeplaneApplications.mm">application areas.</a>
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The goal of this Tutorial is to describe the most used functions of Freeplane in a simple and systematic way. For more and more detailed information, see the documentation at <a href="freeplane.mm">Help &gt; Documentation</a>.
    </p>

  - Reading guide
    - 

<p>
      It is a general practice that people don't like reading manuals. Therefore you only need to read the introduction of this<i> Tutorial</i> to be ready to start mind mapping using the Freeplan main menu bar. The main editing functions are to be found in <i>menu Edit</i>. And some very special functions are to be found in <i>menu Tools</i>.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The chapters after the Introduction are worth reading for the following reason. In Freeplane the same result can be achieved in a number of ways. Using the Freeplane menu generally is not the fastest and most effcient way. The different chapters cover all of the functionality and show what is the most efficient way of doing using socalled context menus. You do not need to read the chapters in order, but can pick the things you are needing at the moment. To help you pick the sections are color coded, with the following meaning:<br>
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Beginner</b> (lighter-blue/green): You learn basic elements which could be used for simple but productive tasks like taking notes and brainstorming.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Advanced</b> (yellow): You learn additional elements which could be used for better  organizing information and better communicating meaning.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Professional</b> (orange/brown): You learn about setting preferences and using production and technical tools.
      </li>
    </ol>

<p>
      A mind map is a plane consisting of so called <b>nodes</b> which can display information. In a sense, a node is comparable to a <b>paragraph</b> of a book which can display text, images and other types of information. The difference being that nodes can be moved around and be hidden more easily. This makes maps more versatile in situations where information is being developed or information must be displayed selectively, depending on the users need.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      The text you are reading right now is in a node. The text above, "<i>Nodes</i>" is a node. Also the text to the left, "<i>Introduction</i>" is a node. The big oval to the left is a special node called <b>root</b>.
    </p>

  - Family relations
    - 

<p>
      All nodes are connected through lines called <b>edges.</b> The line you see at the left is an
    </p>
    <p>
      edge. Aseries of connected nodes are similar to branches of a <b>tree</b>. All trees begin in
    </p>
    <p>
      the root node. Together these branches form a family descendancy. Nodes closer to
    </p>
    <p>
      the root are called (grand)<b>parents</b> of nodes further away called (grand)<b>children</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nodes which ar at the same level, but not mutually connected, are called  <b>siblings</b>.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      As a rule a node's position is rescricted by its position in the family tree. The exception
    </p>
    <p>
      to this rule is the so-called<b> free node</b>  which can be positioned independently of all other
    </p>
    <p>
      nodes.
    </p>

        - child [#1105307139](#1105307139)
  - Folding nodes
    - 

<p>
      Generally, you can <b>fold</b> and <b>unfold</b> a node by clicking the node when the circle with plus or minus sign is showing. This circle appears when the cursor is above the node core.  Folding will hide possible children. If a node is folded, it shows a small <b>circle</b> at its <b>child side</b>. Unfolding will reveal hidden children.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have me unfolded, to my right you see 4 icons wich also are displayed in the toolbar at the top of the screen. These are icon-buttons with which you can fold/unfold the descendants of a selected node. Right-clicking the folding circle will reveal a context menu with the same icon-buttons for fast access.<br><br>Now click on node <i>Introduction</i>  to hide its children  and notice the circle!  And thereafter, click again to continue reading the following node.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Exceptions</b>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>
          Clicking the circle with +/- folds/unfolds immediately; clicking elsewhere in the node core folds with a short delay.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        It is possible to keep a node from folding by setting <i>Edit &gt; Node Group &gt; Always unfolded node (set/unset)</i>. This can be useful in cloud groups.
      </li>
      <li>
        If a node being folded has a connector to one of its hidden children. a line (and possibly a label) is visible which can be right-clicked to open the context menu and jump to the connected node..
      </li>
    </ul>

        - [Note panel](#ID_68046350) {#ID_1377583638}
          - Notes let you include larger, more detailed, more document-like information in your maps.
            - Nodes typically contain a few keywords only.
        - [background color](#ID_217694395)
          - Background color lets you pick the color of the workspace.  The default is white, but you have the full range of colors to choose from.
            - Some users like to stick with the white background and default black text.  While others prefer a darker background or even an image.
        - [Outline view](#ID_66647782)
          - Freeplane defaults to a map, where branches radiate outward from the root node.  Outline view lets you see the information in your map in a more traditional outline, with the root node at the top with branches below.
            - Think of Outline view as a Roman numeral outline -- without the letters and numerals.
            - Map view, generally, tends to spread out horizontally, particularly for small maps and maps with branches only on one side of the root node.
            - Outline view always is vertical.
          - Here is a sample

        - [Miscellaneous](#ID_1649950531)
          - The remaining options on the right-click menu can be helpful for display and navigation.  These options also have related menu items and, in some cases, default keyboard shortcuts.
            - Full screen mode
              - Lets you maximize your workspace, with no toolbars and other workspace elements visible.  This gives you the maximum room to work on your map.  It also is useful for sharing your map with others as a presentation.
              - [Here is how](#ID_671026272)
            - Zoom to fit to page
              - Fits all visible nodes within the workspace.  Nodes or branches that are not visible, either because of folding or filtering, will remain hidden.
              - This may be useful if you have zoomed in or out to see one part of the map but now want to see the whole map.
              - The more visible nodes a map has, the smaller each node is when you zoom to fit the map to the workspace.
              - [See how](#ID_1041694622)
            - Center selected node
              - Positions the current node to the center of the workspace, both horizontally and vertically.
                - Note: if multiple nodes are selected, only the first node that was selected is centered.
              - [Here is how](#ID_821639211)
            - Goto root
              - Lets you quickly navigate to the root node.  Since the root node is the map's subject, to which everything in the map is related, it is often necessary to leave a branch, return to the root, and find a different branch.  Goto root gets you back to the root node from wherever you are in the map.
              - [Here is how](#ID_1570396934)
            - Goto node with ID...
              - Lets you quickly navigate to a node -- if you have that node's unique ID.
              - [Here is how](#ID_1350954187)
            - Open maps
              - Lets you quickly make any open map the currently-active map for viewing or editing.
              - [Here is how](#ID_750416001)
            - Split views
              - You can see multiple maps at once by dragging them, by their tabs, onto the workspace.
              - This is very useful if you want to examine two (or more) different maps or if you want to examine two (or more) different parts of the same map.
              - [Here is how](#ID_1386370819)
    - How to
      - To view or hide workspace elements
        - You have control over which workspace elements are visible and which are hidden.  This gives you flexibility to make your workspace look the way you want.
          - Note: In the descriptions below, keyboard shortcuts (if assigned) appear next to menu items.

            - Hover over the tab of one map, press and hold the left mouse button, and drag the tab onto the workspace -- indicated by bounding boxes, previewing a valid position to which you can drop the map.

            - When you see the bounding box in the desired position, remove your finger from the mouse button.  The map will remain where the bounding box was.
            - In effect, this creates a new map view, showing two maps simultaneously.  This is similar to a window which has two panes.
            - different sections of the same map
              - To simultaneously display sections of the same maps in the workspace you must first create a copy of the map.
